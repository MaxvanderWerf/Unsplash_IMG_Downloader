# Script to Automatically Download and Set Desktop Wallpaper
For my first independent project I've written a Python script that automatically downloads pictures from Unsplash.com

* Using Selenium, the script opens Unsplash.com and searches for wallpapers by randomly selecting a searchterm from a list to add some variety
* The script then downloads the wallpapers from Unsplash.com 
* Finally, the script automatically sets the desktop background 
* Using a batch file and Windows Task Manager, this script is executed daily to provide me with a fresh new background everyday
